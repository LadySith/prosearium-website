Prosearium.net is an initiative to get 1000 African women of all backgrounds to create and upload their own games to tell their own stories and contribute to a garden of digital experiences by African women.

#### Why?
We envision the digital future of Africa where all genders have a visible stake in the game development industry and benefit from it financially, culturally and socially. The games industry is still growing, and its global revenue has exceeded that of the film industry. However, very few games have representation of African women through their characters, stories and even their creators. Prosearium.net would like to take a step forward to increase the participation of African women in game development and carve a space in the continentâ€™s digital history.
