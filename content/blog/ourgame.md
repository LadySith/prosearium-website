## Here's a post about these two game developers you can see in the picture up here. Keep reading!

### Tell us about yourself?
#### **Left:** I like sitting on this bench and talking to Right whenever I can. This is were we've spent most of our life and I've grown rather fond of this place
#### **Right:** Mostly the same! Except I do everything a little later than Left because traditionally, where I'm from, that's how we order things.

### Do you have any previous game development experience?
#### **Left:** Yes! I've been making games for as long as I can remember.
#### **Right:** I've been making games for a long time too! Left and I started at just about the same time. It's almost like we were made to do it together

### What inspired your last game?
#### **Left:** We've been searching for meaning and trying to learn from each other's perspectives. Right sees a totally different world than I do since she's always facing the same direction and I am Technology
#### **Right:** I was about to say the same thing! I've always wondered what Left sees and if it's any different from my world

### Are you a couple?
#### **Left:** Haha. A couple of plastic dolls here to help you make content while you wait for your first interviews? Yeah we are.
#### **Right:** ...Huh?
