## An insight into a new game developer on the scene and her favorite earrings. Keep Reading!

### Tell us about yourself
#### I haven't figured myself out fully.

### Do you have any previous game development experience?
#### No. I'm not even sure I have experience now. I just finished this one game and I can't get over it.

### What does it feel like having made your first game?
#### I wish I could tell you but to be honest, it almost feels like this game was someone else's idea. Like it's existence is an elaborate plot to fulfil someone else's narrative to further their cause. I mean is it even real? It's wonderful to have created something but all this time I've been standing here I just wonder what this is all for? I made a game now. Okay. That's really cool right? It makes me feel like I'm a doll standing here to fulfil some void until something more real get's here. That would be awful if it were true. Because I feel great about what I created, but I'm quite skeptical about what's behind all this.

### ...I like your earrings
#### Thanks! They're my fav!
